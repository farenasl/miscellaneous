This script is created due to a problem happened in my personal files.

When I do monetary transactions I save the transaction vouchers in a year's corresponding name folder

The vouchers have a naming convention detemined by the rules:
* First two digits represent the month of the transaction.
* Underscore sign ( **_** ).
* Number which represent the qty of transactions in the month

In example if the saved voucher represents the twelfth transaction of the month of March of the year 2025,
the file will be saved inside of the folder 2025 with the name 03_12.pdf

# Problem
By mistake I performed some transactions in the 1st day of February, but I saved the vouchers as January vouchers

# Reaction
After manually fixed 3 of these wrongly named files, I decided to create a shell script to practice and do it automatically 

# Actions
* Create a shell script
* Localize the execution path in the corresponding folder (path hardcoded if it's not provided as argument for the execution)
* List all files with wrong name (filters applied to avoid properly named files)
* Use command move (**mv**) to rename the files with the corresponding name

# Results
At the end all next files were renamed as follow

__*first column renamed as original incorrect name*__

__*second column renamed as final correct name*__
