This project is created due to a problem happened in my personal Mega account

# Problem
With no reason, some of my files were moved to trash without full path and/or ability to restore it, some of them were duplicated in different folders, and some others just desappear

# Reaction
MEGA support's team was not able to identify or fix the issue

# Actions
I've downloaded to my local machine all files of MEGA trash and now I have to verify if this files from trash has a copy in my valid MEGA directory, to do this, I'm going to create a shell script to get all files inside of an specific folder and then verify if every single file exist in a directory inside of valid MEGA directory. I will check the next fields:
* full file names
* file size
* file creation datetime
